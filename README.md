# MATLAB-Star-Speed-Plotting-and-Calculations
This Script extracts data on the spectra(light intensity spectrum) of 7 different star constellations. Using this spectra we compare the Hydrogen Alpha line (minimum light intensity point) to the known Hydrogen Absorption point to find the speed &amp; direction star is moving in.
